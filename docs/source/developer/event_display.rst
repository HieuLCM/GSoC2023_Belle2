Event Display
=============

The following documentation is written under the assumption that you already have a basic understanding of Phoenix and how to use it.

Customized Objects
------------------

In the Belle II event display, there are four types of objects that are shown: Tracks, MCParticles, ECLClusters, and KLMClusters. Among them, only Tracks are represented based on the existing design of Phoenix. The rest, on the other hand, are directly drawn using ThreeJS, ensuring that the visualization is appropriate for the Belle II context.
